# Sorting-Algorithms-with-calculating-time-of-sorting
This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in C++, including bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort. Each implementation includes a function to measure the time it takes to sort a given input array. These implementations can be used as a reference for learning and implementing sorting algorithms, and the time measurement functions can be used to compare the performance of different algorithms
